# Qiskit Resources

Hey Qiskitter! We've curated all the resources you should have to dive deeper into quantum computing here. 

Happy Learning ðŸŽ‰

## Qiskit
Qiskit is an open source SDK for working with quantum computers at the level of pulses, circuits and application modules. You can get started with Qiskit [here.](https://qiskit.org/) The Qiskit team has also designed a lot of learning resources, you can see them [here.](https://qiskit.org/learn)

[**The Qiskit Textbook**](https://qiskit.org/textbook/preface.html) is one of the best places to start learning and will teach you the concepts of quantum computing while you learn to use the Qiskit SDK.

You can also contribute to the development of Qiskit [here](https://github.com/qiskit).
